        One of the major benefi ts of inheritance is code reusability. It means that all methods of a class can be reused in other classes without rewriting them. As the following inheritance hierarchy (fi gure-2) depicts, class Commo contains a method getSquare(), which can be used by derived classes Circle and Cylinder to calculate area and volume, respectively.
